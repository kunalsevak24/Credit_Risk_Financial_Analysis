# Credit_Risk_Financial_Analysis

Explanation
Input Layer:

The Input layer is used as the first layer in the model to specify the input shape.
This avoids the warning message and follows best practices.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, suitable for binary classification.
Model Training:

The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
The training process includes validation data to monitor the model's performance on unseen data.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, and the loss and accuracy are printed.
Visualization:

The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's performance over epochs.
This complete process demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model for credit risk prediction using synthetic financial data.
